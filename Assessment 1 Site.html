<h3 style="color:green;">Job Description</h3>
<p>
The position encompasses everything that has to do with the IT systems in the company. Everything that involves the development and improvement of the appropriate IT systems which includes its layout, uses, as well as risks will be included in the job. This will be related to the IT systems that are used by employees, as well as applications that would be used as a bridge between employees and clients. I am interested in this position since problem solving that is a key factor in this position, which is something I have always enjoyed doing in any type of environment.
</p>
<br>

<h3 style="color:green;">Skills/Qualifications Required</h3>
<p>
In order to successfully apply to this position, the most important skills an applicant must have should come from his/her experience in creating and maintaining large-scale IT systems that have multiple parties involved. Additional skills include managing and leading a team and experience working in a fast-paced business environment that would involve analysing the existing business processes and coming up with solutions.
</p>
<br>

<h3 style="color:green;">Personal Skills/Qualifications</h3>
<p>
I have experience working as a team leader for 4 months and the job entailed creating schedules and tasks for the members to do, as well as leading and facilitating weekly team meetings. I learned how to think quickly about the processes involved as well as what potential solutions could be considered for various situations. We had to interview and talk to customers that would fit the program we were offering, so it would be related to a recruitment process from a general standpoint. 
</p>
<br>

<h3 style="color:green;">Future Plans</h3>
<p>
I lack experience in the main requirement of the job, creating and maintaining IT systems which I believe I can obtain some experience in pursuing my current degree in IT. I must continuously search for opportunities aside from doing well in my classes since practical experience is a must, and it would also be much more useful and important in this job. I can build off my previous leadership experience by being more forward of my ideas and being more a more active participant in whatever opportunity I may take.

<h4 style="text-align:center; color: red;">Leadership Style Quiz Results[5]</h4>

<h3 style="color:green;">Test Results Analysis</h3>
<p>
The results in these tests mean a lot to me as they tell me how I act as a person. The Myers-Briggs tests tells me that I am very introverted and feeling in terms of emotions which are two traits I was aware of. It is a tossup between my mental energy and tactics which makes sense to me as I’ve always felt that I have been impartial in many conflicts I’ve encountered before. My learning style and leadership style also tie in with one another since they both tell me how I have a curiosity for knowledge, and this may lead me to do risky things in the pursuit of this. I also like getting straight to the point with things which matches the pragmatist style of learning.
<br><br>These results will make me more aware and try to hold back on my impatience since this is conflicting with me being impartial with people’s opinions. This may prevent the team from coming together, so I must learn to listen more first being acting on my thoughts. I must also try to take my time in reacting to things since my emotions may get the better of me, and this would also be counter productive for the team. 
<br><br>When forming a team, I would inform the members to help me take a step back if they feel that I am going too fast, or if they feel that my emotions are taking over. I will also try to get to know everyone on the team well so that we will be able to work cohesively, and so that future conflicts could be mitigated.

<h1 style="text-align:center; color:rgb(255,115,142)"><a name="projectidea">Project Idea</a></h1>

<h3 style="color:green;">Overview</h3>
<p>
The project I have in mind would be a video game that is able to change based on how the user plays. This would be a crossover between a mystery game and a visual novel. The game will have multiple paths a user can choose throughout the game, and these branches will stem from significant events that occur in-game that require more logical thinking and/or moral reasoning. These choices will also be affected by the other minor choices the player has made so far, or the player’s playstyle.
</p>
<br>

<h3 style="color:green;">Motivation</h3>
<p>
This project would be interesting as it would give the player a personalized game experience that suits his/her behaviour and preferences. The data from the playthrough can also be used for future behavioural research, as well as for creation of an artificial intelligence system that could more accurately determine and predict human behaviour, as well as create even better games of this genre in the future.
</p>
<br>

<h3 style="color:green;">Description</h3>
<p>
The game would use an 8-bit graphics so that the focus would be on the decision-making that is needed while playing it rather than exuberant graphics. Majority of the game would consist of events that occur in our everyday lives, and the decisions we make while doing these things would affect events in the future and the choices we are given there. 
<br><br>For example, while playing through the game I happen to interact with person A than person B more due to our interest in him/her. When a crime occurs that puts all suspicion on person A and person B, we would more likely have a stronger opinion on person A in our selection of responses since we had more interactions with that person. Consequently, the choices that talk about person B would have less conviction. Interacting with objects related to a crime or mystery could also help make better claims in the process of piecing things together. 
<br><br>The objectives of the game will be written in a virtual calendar, simulating a to-do list. The order in which the player does these tasks, as well as he does or skips them can give more information on the player’s behavioural patterns. Other interactable objects will be available in the game as well, and these would also affect the occurrences later in the game. The first playthrough would be used for the main behavioural pattern of the player as this is what seemed most natural to the player to do. Consequent playthroughs could tell us other things about the player such as curiosity or perfectionism, and the adjustments they make can also be valuable data for adaptation. 
</p>
<br>

<h3 style="color:green;">Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>
Since the game is 8-bit, powerful hardware won’t be required to run the game so any modern-day desktop or laptop would be enough. Python would be the preferred method of coding this game due to its simplicity and readability, and the number of available libraries along with the easy learning curve. However, Java will most likely be used as I am currently more familiar with it, and it isn’t bad for creating games and AI technology as well. [1]
</p>
<br>

<h3 style="color:green;">Skills Required</h3>
<p>
A good understanding of how decisions work and how these are affected by a person’s behavioural patterns would be needed, along with knowledge on creating a simple game program on Java.
</p>
<br>

<h3 style="color:green;">Outcome</h3>
<p>
If the project is successful, people will be able to enjoy a customized experience that also helps in the research of human behaviour. This could lead to much better and accurate games of this type in the future, along with the development of an AI that could predict human behavioural patterns.
